Gallery2 Theme
=================

[Gallery2][] theme leveraging [Twitter Bootstrap][] (v1.4.0).  No release yet but the theme works and uses less.js in dev mode (not suggested for production at the moment).

Demo: [http://chrishemp.com/gallery2-bootstrap/][]

Usage
-----

Right now the ZIP produced by GitHub can be extracted into the themes folder of your Gallery2 installation.

The modules folder of the archive needs to be placed in the modules folder of your Gallery2 installation.  Some of the core blocks used could not be done only with css (breadcrumbs, paging) so local smarty templates were created (gallery2 allows for tpl overrides to be placed in a 'local' folder).
